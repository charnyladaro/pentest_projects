# Building Your Own Cybersecurity Lab and Cyber Range

This guide provides tips and instructions for creating your own lab for penetration testing and practicing different defensive techniques helpful for incident response and digital forensics.

## Pen Testing Linux Distributions

While you can download and install most penetration testing tools on various operating systems, certain popular security-focused Linux distributions bundle hundreds of tools, making it easier to start without worrying about dependencies and compatibility issues. Here are the three most popular Linux distributions for ethical hacking (penetration testing):

- **Kali Linux:** Probably the most popular, supported, and maintained by Offensive Security. You can download it from [here](https://www.kali.org) and easily install it on various systems, including bare-metal, virtual machines, and devices like the Raspberry Pi and Chromebooks.
  Note: Offensive Security offers free training and a book for installing Kali Linux, accessible [here](https://kali.training).

- **Parrot:** Another popular distribution among pen testers and security researchers, installable on bare-metal and virtual machines, downloadable from [here](https://www.parrotsec.org).

- **BlackArch Linux:** This distribution boasts over 2300 tools and packages and is also gaining popularity. You can download BlackArch Linux from [here](https://blackarch.org).

- **The PenTesters Framework (PTF):** A Python script designed for Debian/Ubuntu/ArchLinux-based distributions to create a similar distribution for Penetration Testing. Created by David Kennedy and maintained by the community.

- **Pentoo Linux:** A Live CD and Live USB designed for penetration testing and security assessment, based on Gentoo Linux. It's specifically tailored for security professionals and enthusiasts, focusing on providing a lightweight and flexible environment. Pentoo Linux avoids the systemd init system, instead using the OpenRC init system known for its simplicity and ease of customization.

- **PwnMachine by YesWeHack:** A self-hosting solution based on Docker aiming to provide an easy-to-use pwning station for bug hunters, including a web interface, a DNS server, and a reverse proxy.

## Privacy-Oriented Distributions

- [**Tails**](https://tails.net/)
- [**Whonix**](https://www.whonix.org/)
- [**Qubes OS**](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
- [**Ubuntu Privacy Remix**](https://distrowatch.com/?newsid=06318)
- [**Subgraph OS**](https://subgraph.com/)

## Vulnerable Servers and Applications

In a safe lab environment, you can deploy intentionally vulnerable applications and virtual machines to practice your skills, some of which can be run in Docker containers.

Check out my own [Vulnerable Servers Section](https://github.com/charnyladaro/pentestlab/tree/main/Hacking_Lab) of this GitHub repository to obtain a list of dozens of vulnerable applications and VMs that can be used to practice your skills.
